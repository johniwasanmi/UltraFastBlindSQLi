Here's the revised README with an emphasis on the fact that the script is **not an exploit**, but rather an educational tool that demonstrates how SQL anding, multithreading, and multiprocessing can be combined to speed up Blind Boolean-Based SQL Injection:

# UltraFastBlindSQLi - SQL Injection Password Cracking Tool

**UltraFastBlindSQLi** is an educational tool designed to demonstrate how **SQL ANDing**, **multithreading**, and **multiprocessing** can be combined to **significantly increase the speed** of **Blind Boolean-Based SQL Injection (SQLi)** attacks. The script is **not an exploit** but rather a demonstration of how different techniques can be optimized together to efficiently perform Blind Boolean-based SQL injection for educational purposes.

The primary goal of the script is to show how SQL techniques and performance optimizations can help reduce the time required to dump a target's password in a Blind Boolean SQLi attack.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `json` library (included by default in Python)
- `multiprocessing` and `concurrent.futures` modules (included by default in Python)

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## How It Works

1. **Blind Boolean-Based SQL Injection**: The script demonstrates **blind boolean-based SQL injection**, where the server returns different responses based on whether the injected query evaluates to true or false. This approach is useful when the server does not provide error-based feedback. The script sends crafted SQL queries to test various conditions, and based on the server's response, it determines if a specific condition (like a character in the password) is true or false.

2. **SQL ANDing**: The script uses **SQL ANDing** combined with bitwise operations (`&`) to efficiently break down the ASCII values of characters. This allows the tool to check multiple conditions in a single query, speeding up the process of determining each character of the password.

3. **Multithreading and Multiprocessing**: 
   - **Multithreading**: For each bitwise query, the script uses **multithreading** to perform checks concurrently for different bit positions of the ASCII value.
   - **Multiprocessing**: The script also leverages **multiprocessing** to parallelize the entire process of retrieving each character in the password, using all available CPU cores to speed up execution.

4. **Optimized Speed**: By combining SQL ANDing with multithreading and multiprocessing, the script demonstrates how these techniques can be used to **significantly reduce the time** required to crack the password compared to traditional brute-force approaches.

5. **Educational Purpose**: The tool is meant to showcase the power of optimization in SQL injection techniques and is **not an exploit** for unauthorized use. It is for learning how to combine different techniques to increase the speed and efficiency of Blind Boolean-Based SQLi attacks.

## Usage

### Configuration

1. **Target Setup**: Modify the following lines to suit your target:
   - **Line 12**: Set the `target` variable to the username you want to attack (e.g., `"admin"`).
   - **Line 18**: Set the `url` variable to the API endpoint URL where the vulnerable SQL injection occurs (e.g., `"http://example.com/api/check-username.php"`).
   - **Line 29**: Set the `length` variable to the known or estimated length of the password.

2. **Run the Script**: Once youâ€™ve configured the target, simply execute the script from the terminal:

```bash
python3 UltraFastBlindSQLi.py
```

3. **Output**: The script will output the password it retrieves for the target, along with the total execution time.

## Example Output

```
[*] Password = xxxxxxxxx
[*] Code executed in 1.34 seconds
```

## Notes

- **Not an Exploit**: **UltraFastBlindSQLi** is not an exploit but an educational demonstration that explains how SQL ANDing, multithreading, and multiprocessing can be combined to speed up Blind Boolean-Based SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks.
- **Blind Boolean-Based SQL Injection**: This tool uses a **blind boolean-based SQL injection** technique, where the server's response indicates whether a condition is true or false. The tool does not rely on error messages or data returned from the server.
- **Security Warning**: This script is for **educational purposes only**. It should **only** be used on systems for which you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of this tool may be illegal.
- **Customization**: You can modify the `target`, `url`, and password length to suit your needs. For dynamic password length detection, you can modify the logic in the script.
- **Optimization Goal**: The purpose of this tool is to **demonstrate how to optimize** Blind Boolean SQLi by combining SQL ANDing with multithreading and multiprocessing to reduce the time required to crack a password.

This version should make it clear that the script is an educational tool for demonstrating optimization techniques, rather than an exploit. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!
